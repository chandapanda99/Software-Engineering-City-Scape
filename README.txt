1. Open Package
2. Run Pong or Background depending on what you want to see
3. W to move up, S to move down
4. If you are prone to seizures or get light-headed very easily, you probably shouldn't play this
5. For the actual minimum requirements, open Background, since the buildnings that I create seem to be covered up by a black screen
